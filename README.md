# Project-2_SokobanGame

In this project, I was asked to create the famous game Sokoban in Java. The difficulty increases as you progress through the levels. You can move the character using the arrow keys or the mouse. The movement is implemented using BFS (Breadth-First Search). A small Oracle database is used to save game progress.
